```

3. Run the program

## GUI Usage

If you would like to use the GUI for a sinlge file use the GUI_SCORESABER_File.py. Once ran, you will have the option to select the .dat replay file and the output folder. Hit start once you have selected both. 

If you would like to use the GUI for a batch of files use GUI_SCORESABER_Folder.py. Before running the program, put all .dat files into a folder on your computer. Now you can run the program to select the folder you created then press start. All files will be processed accordingly

## Maintaining this project

This project was written initially to support ScoreSaber replay files V2 and then updated to work exclusively with V3.

Whenever ScoreSaber updates how replay files are saved, you'll need to add or remove any fields that were changed in [this file](https://github.com/ScoreSaber/scoresaber-plugin/blob/5c4ec68d472d53df66e3530099752b1567471c64/ScoreSaber/Core/ReplaySystem/Data/ReplayFile.cs) (if the link is broken, look for `ReplayFile.cs` in the [scoresaber-plugin](https://github.com/ScoreSaber/scoresaber-plugin) repo).

Feel free to make the change yourself and then open a pull request to add it to the project! I'd appreciate it ðŸ˜‰
